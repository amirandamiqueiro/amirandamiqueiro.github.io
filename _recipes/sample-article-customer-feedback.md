Imagine yourself as the town baker in some city of old. You are passionate about making that
bread. But, somehow, you inadvertently used some spoiled ingredient. Something went wrong,
but you didn’t notice. Suddenly, people stop going to your bakery. If someone doesn’t come and
tell you, everything can come crashing down, and you can find yourself not being a baker
anymore.

Of course, it doesn’t have to be so dramatic. But the truth is that no matter what you do, town
bakery of old or software company of our day and time, what customers are saying can save (or
ruin) your day. The difference between the bakery and the software company is basically
globalization: massive amounts of information —2.5 quintillion bytes of data— are created every
day. So a “Hey! Bread wasn’t so good today.” in person just won’t do it anymore.
That’s where keyword analysis comes into play. Because, if you can grasp the essence of the
feedback your customers are giving you —in terms of the most meaningful expressions— without
having to go through every word, then you are all set. Customer feedback can come in many
forms, three of which are NPS responses, customer surveys, and analyzing customer reviews.

## NPS responses

NPS is simple, and can save you a lot of trouble all by itself. Customers express their willingness
of recommending you with a number from 0 to 10, thus becoming a Promoter (score 9-10), a
Passive (score 7-8), or a Detractor (score 0-6). Just knowing this number is a useful thing, as
Promoter.io can tell you, for it is a good quantitative measure of how your service or product is
faring.

But you can add to it about two more flavors of usefulness: by asking customers why they gave
you that score as an open-ended question, you can not only extract relevant keywords that
directly reflect how everything is going, but also use them as thermometer of how the public feel
about your bread (enter sentiment analysis).

## Customer surveys

The more text there is to it, the more useful keyword analysis becomes — which is the case with
customer surveys. It’s the same idea as with NPS responses, but broader. Every customer has a
story, so why not ask for it in the form of a survey? Again, automated keyword analysis can play
a key role here by doing all the processing and hard work for you.

## Customer reviews

Many people are willing to share their story, but most will just do it whether you ask for it or
not. As of 2019, 80% of consumers of 18-34 years old have written online reviews. Be it on
Capterra, G2Crowd, Amazon or Google Play, product reviews on the Internet will only increase.

This is too valuable a source of information to be left ignored. But the higher the numbers, the
more difficult it will become to process all that free feedback (it is difficult enough as it is), so,
in the future, keyword analysis will just be an indispensable tool to use — not only to discover if
something’s wrong with your bread, but to gain valuable insights on how can you improve it,
and deliver its best possible version.
